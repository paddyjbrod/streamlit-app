# FlavorWeb 
##  A recommendation engine for ingredient to ingredient compatibility
 This is a streamlit app to showcase my FlavorWeb recommendation engine.  The app uses a variety of collaborative filtering and NLP methods to identify latent relationships
between ingredients in a dataset of 1 million+ recipes consisting of 3500+ unique ingredients.

 User inputs an ingredient and a list of ten ingredients is returned that the model recommends as compatible.  The user can then chose one of these ingredients and input it again
into the app, building a dish ingredient by ingredient until something novel is created.  Use case demo is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61SNK8TLefQ
